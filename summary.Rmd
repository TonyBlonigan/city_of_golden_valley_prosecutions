1. CC and ACS populations have very different distributions of race
  - Black people are disproportionately targeted
  - Many people from out of Golden Valley (use residency CC data set)
2. CC Fisher's Exact Test shows disposition is not independent of race
  -  Black people are put into probation
3. How does gender play into this? (use gender data set)

4. Same thing with low level non driving
5. Different thing showing huge set of low level driving prosecutions from state patrol
  - Are the racial dispositions related to police force?
